This is the beginings of Audio manipulation routines for perl.

Currently can load or save Sun/Next .au/.snd files and play them 
via Network Audio Server (from ftp.x.org) or native /dev/audio
on Suns. 

Now also works on Win32.

There is an attempt at several other drivers as well but I have no 
way of testing them.

Anyone who knows how to configure RedHat Linux 5.1 to work with 
Ensoniq AudioPCI (as in my Gateway G6-400) please let me know ;-)
