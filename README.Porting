To add/fix drivers look at Play/Makefile.PL to see how the 
architecture specific sub-class is built.

Then edit Play/config/* and re-run Makefile.PL

Only Play/config/sun* have been tested
     Play/config/next* have been fully converted
  
Rest of Play/config/* are really .c files from rsynth-2.0 and 
need coberting to true .xs files.
